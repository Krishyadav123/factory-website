    "fiberFabrics" : "Shreeinsul Ceramic Fiber Fabrics are manufactured using ceramic fiber yarn reinforced with fiberglass filament or stainless steel wire. These fabrics are ideal for many high temperature applications",
    "fiberYarn": "Shreeinsul Ceramic Fiber Yarn is made from high quality Alumino silicate fibers with reinforcement of SS wire/continuous fiberglass filament to increase handling strength during installation and enhance fiber durability. The fiberglass reinforcement has a temperature rating of 650°C. These yarns contain 15% organic carrier which helps to establish the physical formation of products. Shreeinsul Ceramic Fiber Yarn is manufactured using advanced technology and machinery of carding, spinning, and doubling system.",
