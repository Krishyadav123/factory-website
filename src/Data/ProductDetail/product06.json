          "PUF": "Polyurethane (PUF) foam has outstanding insulation properties to maintain temperature in cold / hot environments. PUF Materials are suitable for temperature range between -180°C to +110°C.",
          "PIR": "Polyisocyanurate (PIR) foam slabs and pipe sections are suitable for use between -200°C to +150°C. It has low thermal conductivity value of maximum 0.021 W/mk at 10°C. It is not easily ignitable and has negligible water permeability, making it most suited for cold/chilled pipelines & equipment. PIR is the recommended insulation material for LNG pipe insulation."
