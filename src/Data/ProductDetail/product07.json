    "description": "Shreeinsul Ceramic Fiber Round and Square Braided Ropes are dense and fabricated from high performance ceramic fiber yarn material braided around a core of ceramic fiber to form a packing in round or square shape. Shreeinsul is manufacturing a variety of Ceramic fiber ropes to meet the requirement of our valued customers. These ropes are manufactured from high performance ceramic fibers. Shreeinsul ropes are lightweight and have high temperature resistance. Shreeinsul ropes are designed to improve the strength for pulling and connecting. The twisted rope contains 15% organic carrier which helps to establish physical formation of products which burn out at about 400 °C.",
